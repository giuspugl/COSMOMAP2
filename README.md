# COSmic Microwave background linear Operators MAp-making Preconditioner 2-levels
This repository will contain a package which performs the solution of Linear System via preconditioning it in 2 steps ( see  Szyldlarski et al.2014). The whole system matrices are  implemented as  Linear Operators.

*The code  is fully built within a python context since the whole Analisys Backend of the collaboration is dealt in python.*
